            ESP32-based system integrating five sensors: color, total dissolved solids (TDS),
            turbidity, temperature, and pH. The apparatus was used to collect sensor data from
            green milk tea samples across five different retail stores.

      <h2 class="project-section">Objective</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The objective of this project was to use a sensor data–driven machine learning
        approach to distinguish between green milk tea samples using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm.
      </p>

      <h2 class="project-section">Methods</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        To minimize variability, all green milk tea samples were ordered with zero sugar and no ice.
        Sensors were not formally calibrated. However, all sensor measurements were recorded using the same apparatus and consistent conditions.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        With the exception of total dissolved solids (TDS) and temperature, all sensor readings were taken as raw values.
        Measurements were recorded every 10 seconds over a 500-second period, with the first 200 seconds excluded from the analysis to maintain stabilized readings.
        Although the data from the F1-F8 spectral channels, which span approximately 415-680nm, were sample-specific and valuable, they were excluded due to risk of overfitting the kNN model.
        Temperature readings were also excluded due to low variability between samples and treated as a noise factor.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        A kNN classifier (k=3) was selected for its compatability with small datasets and its ability to model disjoint decision regions, with performance evaluated using a 70:30 train:test split.
        All remaining features were normalized to ensure equal weighting during kNN classification.
      </p>

      <h2 class="project-section">Results</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Model performance was evaluated using a classification report summarizing precision, recall, and F1-score across the five locations.
        While the kNN classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 91% on the test set, F1-scores for Sunright and Wushiland were lower, 
        demonstrating a clear tradeoff between precision and recall that was likely caused by overlap in sensor measurements.

      <p class="muted">
        To visualize classification performance, a confusion matrix was generated. 
        Several Sunright samples were misclassified as Wushiland, and one Feng Cha sample was misclassified as Bear Cup.
